The world is full of problems. I've spoken to so many people who feel that technology is the root of most of our problems today. I can see how one might come to that conclusion, but I'm too much of an optimist to believe that. In the 9+ years that I have been working in IT (12+ if you count my college help desk job), I have seen the potential for technology to do some amazing things and some noteworthy progress in many of those directions. Technology is an enabler. It enables us to be more efficient and productive. It allows us to automate and optimize. It permits us to take a step back and look at our problems from different angles, to zoom in and out until we have our plan of attack to conquer it. It can do many great things, but it has to be managed properly. My current employer, BDO, is a firm that respects technology and seems to do a great job of managing it. Most of my clients have not been so lucky. 

My parents raised me to be a helper, a selfless servant, and, frankly, the hands of the God we love and worship. My goal each and every day is to honor him in my work, and I feel lucky that I get to do that helping my clients solve their problems with the effective and efficient use of technology. Hopefully, along the way, I get the opportunity to show the love that he has shown me to those I come in contact with.

I have a beautiful wife and the most precious little boy you've ever seen. They are the joy of my life and I am so proud to call them mine. I'm sure you'll hear more about them in my posts.
