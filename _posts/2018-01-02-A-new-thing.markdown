Well, it's a new year and time to start a new thing. I am hoping to use this blog to share my 
experience in the DevOps space with the world in the hopes that you, the reader, can learn
from my experiences and also help me grow and learn even more than I would have otherwise. Having
just typed that out, lets just say that the theme of this blog is growing and learning with a
focus on everything that is DevOps.

I'm hoping to add more features to the site eventually, to enable things like comments for all of
you. For now, this is going to be a one-way conversation. However, you can always reach out to me
in any number of ways through social media. If it has to do with this site directly, it might be
easiest to hit me up on GitHub as that is where I have this blog hosted from. You can create an
issue in the project to share any ideas with me. I'll also use the project wiki to note some ideas
for future posts. Twitter might be another alternative if a conversational approach is more
appropriate.

I am going to try to make this a weekly thing for now and see how that goes. Next week, I'll start
with a post with some actual tech content in it. Here is a quick synopsis of some topics I hope to
cover soon:

* Ansible
* Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
* Consulting
* Solaris/Linux
* Database (Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc)
* Python Development
* Web services
* Oracle (Support/Platinum Services, Engineered Systems, etc.)
* Jekyll, Wordpress
* ???

Looking forward to hearing back from all of you and learning together.

More soon,  
Thanks!
