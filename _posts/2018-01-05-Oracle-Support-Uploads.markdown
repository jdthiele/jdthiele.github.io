# Oracle Support Uploads Script
If you work with Oracle Support, you know that they are often requesting large amounts of data
to help them troubleshoot a Service Request (SR). Quite often these files are large and 
cumbersome to move around. Wouldn't it be nice to just send the files directly to the SR from
the server they came from? 

Well, I borrowed a script a long time ago and have made some improvements
over the years that I wanted to share. I hope that it will help you save as much time as it has saved
me. I'm also hoping that you will be able to help me improve it some more. Please do point out some
areas for improvement and even submit your pull requests to make it better for all.
