# Automated Weblogic Server-Start Changes

### Download the script
Download from Github: https://github.com/jdthiele/weblogic-server-start-changes

### Overview
I hope you like my new domain name. :-)

I am working on a project to implement a Technology Operations Center (TOC) which is basically a Network Operations Center but with a wider scope to also include application and services stack that IT provides to the organization. We are working to improve the visibility into the health and operations of the critical IT systems and their dependent components. It is a challenging and complex project but it has been rewarding so far. 

One of the monitoring tools that we focused on out of the gates was New Relic. New Relic is a great application performance monitoring tool (among other functionality) that sees deep into custom developed applications 

[New Relic doc for adding the -javaagent argument for WebLogic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/include-java-agent-jvm-argument)

Here's my script ([script.py](https://github.com/jdthiele/weblogic-server-start-changes)). Please do share your thoughts on the GitHub repo for now.

Thanks!
